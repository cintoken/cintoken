- 👋 Hi, I’m @cintoken - (CHILDREN_IN_NEED_TOKEN) AKA (CIN)
The world's first Crypto token designed to MAKE BIG CHANGE FOR SMALL PEOPLE - and give our investors an EVER INCREASING RETURN on investment. How do we do this? by putting aside 5% of every transaction for childrens charities, we distribute 4% of every sale to our holding investors and 1% is burned on every transaction to create a deflationary investment which increases holding amount and dollar value at the same time. 
- 👀 I’m interested in spreading the word about our new crypto token and raising as much money as possible for our investors and our partner children charities. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the world of crypto and who to collaborate with and how to maintain an organic growth for all involved.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on marketing specialists, sales heros, charities that need support, influencers that want to work with a solid and fundamentally good project. I also welcome volunteers that want to support a great project.
